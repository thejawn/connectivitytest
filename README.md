# connectivitytest
To measure the uptime/outages of the local network vs. public network... So that customers can go to their ISP with some proof that their internet sucks.


The program is two parts: 

The client can be run as a task in the background, or you can run it in the foreground. Just set your options in the config file

The Server just need a MySql or Maria DB, copy and paste TableMaker.txt into the database terminal.

I know, nothing is commented, I should read the Pragmatic Programmer again.

This is my first GitHub Entry... good luck
